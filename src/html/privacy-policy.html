  <p>Welcome to our Privacy Policy, and thank you for visiting the website for Paws-Cause, LLC, doing business as Paws For A Cause (“Paws For A Cause” or “us”). We recognize that many visitors to our <a href="/" title="Paws For A Cause Website">website</a> (the “Website”) are concerned about the information that they provide to us or that may be collected, and how we treat that information. In order to address those concerns we have developed this Privacy Policy.

  <h5 class="c-page__subheading u-fontBody">1).  TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</h5>
  <p>At the Website, we may collect both personally identifiable information and non-personal information from you.</p>
  <p><strong>Personally identifiable information</strong>. You don’t have to provide us with your personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, etc.) in order to access most of what’s posted on this Website. We may, however, collect personally identifiable information about you if you submit it to us, such as when you open an account with us, purchase items from us, email us, post content on our Website, or at times when we alert you that you must submit personally identifiable information. Without this information, we would not be able to respond to your purchases, orders, inquiries and requests. Please also note that the Website may offer features which may be operated by third parties (including but not limited to credit card processing). These third parties may also obtain personally identifiable information from you in order to use their services. Please check their privacy policies for information about their privacy practices. In some cases, these third parties may provide your personally identifiable information to us, and we may provide your personally identifiable information to them in order to complete your request. </p>
  <p><strong>Non-personal information</strong>. We do automatically collect non-personal information about visitors to our website. By non-personal information, we mean information that by itself does not identify any specific individual. We collect non-personal information can be about visitors’ activities on our website (such as which pages on the Website are accessed, which products are viewed the most often, what information is downloaded, and referring and exit pages for visitors) or about the types of visitors to our website (such as what type of browser and operating system are being used, which Internet service provider is being used, and information about visitors’ zip codes, area codes, internet protocol (IP) addresses, unique device identifiers and time zones). Please note that while this information does not by itself identify individual visitors, it may do so when combined with other information. Specifically, your IP address is your computer or device’s address on the Internet and can be used to identify the computer or device used to interact with websites.</p>
  <p>By collecting non-personal information, we learn how best to develop our website to meet the needs and desires of our visitors.</p>
